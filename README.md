# devSpotlight

devSpotlight is an application built with Rails that serves as a focal point for the tech community in Vancouver. Google Maps API integration helps the users locate companies they are interested in and can visit a company's profile for more detailed information about the organization. In addition, the Meetup API and a news API gem are also implemented to provide a calendar of relevant tech events and trending news articles in the community.

Users also have the ability to add organizations to the full list (tech organizations directory) and request to be an employee or manager of that company.
